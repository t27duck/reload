# Reload

When I'm in Rails console, I sometimes forget the "!" in reload!. Sometimes I just don't have the time got that extra keystroke.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'reload', :group => :development

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install reload

## Usage

````
=> nil
irb(main):010:0> reload
Reloading...
=> true
irb(main):011:0> 
````
